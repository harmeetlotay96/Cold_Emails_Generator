      "3. Diego Maradona: A legendary Argentine player, Maradona is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, known for his exceptional skill, vision, and leadership on the field.\n",
      "4. Johan Cruyff: A Dutch player and coach, Cruyff is credited with revolutionizing the game with his innovative style of play and his influence on the development of Total Football.\n",
